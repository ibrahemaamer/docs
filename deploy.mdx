## Testing Your Agent

Before publishing your agent to users, it's important to verify it functions as expected:

### Using the Preview Panel

1. Locate the preview panel on the right side of the agent configuration screen
2. Type test messages in the input field to simulate user interactions
3. Observe how your agent responds to various queries
4. Pay attention to both the content and tone of responses

### What to Test

When testing your agent, verify:

- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Does the agent correctly access and use information from your knowledge base?
- **Tool Integration**: Are connected tools (Gmail, Jira, etc.) functioning properly?
- **Instruction Adherence**: Does the agent maintain the persona and follow guidelines you specified?
- **Edge Cases**: Test unusual or complex queries to see how the agent handles them

### Refining Your Agent

Based on test results:

1. Adjust your instructions if the agent's tone or approach needs improvement
2. Add or modify knowledge base content if the agent lacks necessary information
3. Reconfigure tool settings if they aren't working as expected
4. Test voice interactions if you've enabled voice chat

## Publishing Your Agent

When you're satisfied with your agent's performance, you're ready to publish:

1. Click the "Publish" button in the top-right corner of the Playground
2. Confirm your deployment method (Website, iFrame, Chat Bubble, API, Slack)
3. Review the final settings before deployment
