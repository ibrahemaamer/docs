### Step 2: Define Agent Instructions

Instructions are crucial for shaping how your agent behaves:

1. Choose a preset persona (Financial Analyst, Legal Assistant, Travel Guide, or Personal Companion) or create your own
2. Write clear instructions in the editor, including:
   - The agent's role and purpose
   - How it should respond to queries
   - Any specific guidelines for tone and style
   - Limitations or boundaries for responses
