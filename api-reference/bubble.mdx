```
<script>
  window.shipableSettings = {
    agentId: "YOUR_AGENT_ID",
    position: "bottom-right",  // Options: bottom-right, bottom-left, top-right, top-left
    theme: "light",            // Options: light, dark, or custom
    greeting: "Hi there! How can I help you today?",
    logoUrl: "https://yourdomain.com/logo.png"  // Optional
  };
</script>
<script src="https://app.shipable.ai/bubble.js" async></script>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                          | Solution                                                                                      |
| :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chat bubble not appearing      | Verify your Agent ID is correct and the script is properly placed before the closing body tag |
| Styling conflicts with website | Use the iframe integration method instead for complete isolation                              |
| Performance concerns           | The script loads asynchronously and has minimal impact on page load times                     |
| Multiple bubbles appearing     | Ensure the script is only included once across your site                                      |
